# Electronic-Medical-Record

This is some PERL code I wrote back in 2010 while I was laid up after surgery, and wanted to learn more about electronic medical records.
It was based on OpenEMR.
This code was an exercise for me to learn about LAMP stacks, and electronic health records.
This code is not compliant with any regulations, and should not be used for anything other than an academic exercise.
